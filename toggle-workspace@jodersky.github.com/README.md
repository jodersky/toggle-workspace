# Toggle Workspace Gnome 3 Extension

This extension provides a keyboard shortcut (default is ```<Alt>````) to toggle between the current workspace and the first.
Its intended use is to boost productivity by using the first workspace exclusively for an often-used application, such as a browser, users can then quickly switch between their current activity and the other main application.

# Author
This extension was developped by Jakob Odersky. Essential information on keybindings was taken from [vibou.gTile](https://github.com/vibou/vibou.gTile), by
[Vincent Bouvier](https://github.com/vibou).
